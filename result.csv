infernal cmpress,"Starting from a CM database <cmfile> in standard Infernal-1.1 format, construct binary compressed datafiles for cmscan. Infernal ('INFERence of RNA ALignment') is for searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence.",N.

infernal cmscan,"cmscan is used to search sequences against collections of covariance models that have been prepared with cmpress. The output format is designed to be human-            readable, but is often so voluminous that reading it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout option saves output in a simple tabular  format that is concise and easier to parse. The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null.

fastq_screen,"`fastq_screen <http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen>`_
screens a library of sequences in FASTQ format against a set of sequence
databases so you can see if the composition of the library matches with what
you expect.

This wrapper allows the configuration to be passed as a filename or as
a dictionary in the rule's  `params.fastq_screen_config` of the rule. So the
following configuration file::

  DATABASE	ecoli	/data/Escherichia_coli/Bowtie2Index/genome	BOWTIE2
  DATABASE	ecoli	/data/Escherichia_coli/Bowtie2Index/genome	BOWTIE
  DATABASE	hg19	/data/hg19/Bowtie2Index/genome	BOWTIE2
  DATABASE	mm10	/data/mm10/Bowtie2Index/genome	BOWTIE2
  BOWTIE	/path/to/bowtie
  BOWTIE2	/path/to/bowtie2

becomes::

  fastq_screen_config = {
   'database': {
     'ecoli': {
       'bowtie2': '/data/Escherichia_coli/Bowtie2Index/genome',
       'bowtie': '/data/Escherichia_coli/BowtieIndex/genome'},
     'hg19': {
       'bowtie2': '/data/hg19/Bowtie2Index/genome'},
     'mm10': {
       'bowtie2': '/data/mm10/Bowtie2Index/genome'}
   },
   'aligner_paths': {'bowtie': 'bowtie', 'bowtie2': 'bowtie2'}
  }

By default, the wrapper will use bowtie2 as the aligner and a subset of 100000
reads.  These can be overridden using ``params.aligner`` and ``params.subset``
respectively. Furthermore, `params.extra` can be used to pass additional
arguments verbatim to ``fastq_screen``, for example ``extra=""--illumina1_3""`` or
``extra=""--bowtie2 '--trim5=8'""``.
